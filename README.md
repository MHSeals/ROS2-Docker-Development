## CONTRIBUTING

The main branch of this repository is protected, so in order to contribute to this project, you'll need to make **[pull requests](https://youtu.be/jRLGobWwA3Y)** to the main branch.

‚≠ê Although the linked video tells you to fork the repository, you really just need to make a separate branch from the main branch, or from another branch you want to contribute to. ‚≠ê

Make sure you have another person reviewing your code before you merge it to the main branch! We want to make sure that it's code that we *want* to have in the main branch üòä
